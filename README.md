# [Fetch](http://www.fetch.love)

Fetch is a single-page web application designed to crowd-source animal sightings in your community. This model maximizes the ratio of personal risk by good samaritans to useful feedback for lost pets. It was written using front-end frameworks like Backbone, Handlebars, Bootstrap, and jQuery.

### How to Get Started

In Fetch, there are no sign-ups, registrations, log-ins, or authentications. Contributing to your community only requires you to visit the applications url: http://www.fetch.love

There are two ways to use Fetch.
1. When you see an animal in the city, you can upload a picture and some information about the sighting to our database. This can be done is as few as three taps of your screen.
2. When you are seeking an animal, you can search our database of sightings according to several general parameters.

There is no built-in way to directly connect people who have lost their pets with the animals themselves. Fetch is merely a feedback system for gathering information about where your pet has been, and where they might be now. Fetch does invite good-samaritans to include a description with their upload. This is a good place for pet-spotters to announce their intention to shelter the animal, and provide some personal contact information for pet-seekers to connect with them. However, in order to solicit the greatest response from the community, we require the minimum amount of information with every sighting. Thus, this description field is not mandatory.

Fetch also encourages pet-spotters to call their nearby shelters or animal agencies to seek help for a lost animal. This is the absolute best way to reconnect animals to their owners safely, because they are easy to contact, well-understood by pet-owners, and eager to help.

#### Found

If you have sighted an animal in the city, there is no reason not to upload a sighting report. If the location settings on your mobile device are properly configured, it takes less than ten seconds. Simply click "Found" in the top-right corner of the home screen.

Select the type of animal you are looking at. For simplicity's sake, not all animals are represented. If you do not know, or do not see an option for the kind of animal you are looking at, make your best guess, and expand with a note in the description field.

Now you may take a photo, or upload a photo you have already taken. If the location settings on your mobile device are configured to allow GPS tags on your images, most of the form will be accurately pre-populated by your device.

It is very helpful to include a description with your sighting! Anything unique about the animal, or your experience might make identifying the animal easier, and provide useful information to their families. **Especially if you decide to shelter the animal in your home, or move the animal to an animal shelter** Please note this in the description field, as well as any contact information you are comfortable sharing.

That's it! You'll be told your form successfully reached the database, and be shown a map of local animal shelters and services to contact for help.
